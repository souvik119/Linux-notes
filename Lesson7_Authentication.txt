- Public and private key auth 

    no longer need to enter password
    setup RSA key pair, generate public-pvt key pair
    RSA public key is stored on server, pvt key is stored on device
    RSA key pair is more secure and less susecptible to brute force attacks

    MAC:
    ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa* //search for all public - pvt key pairings on system
    if you do not have any pairs only then generate a new pair using following commands:
    ssh-keygen -b 4096
    /Users/souvik12/.ssh/id_rsa
    /Users/souvik12/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    Enter passphrase to encyrpt it

    Add key to server:
    ssh-copy-id root@172.105.25.135

    After this no need for password, just enter the passphrase to decrypt pvt key on device
    ssh root@172.105.25.135

    Windows:
    Use puttygen.exe to generate public-pvt key pairs
    Change size of key to 4096 and make sure RSA is selected
    Enter passphrase (5 digit minimum)
    Save public key (name it as public-key.txt) and pvt key (name it as private-key.ppk)
    Open putty, load session setting, go to Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Select pvt key file then save it

    Add public key to server:
    cd .ssh
    if .ssh folder is not there then:
    mkdir .ssh
    cd .ssh
    touch authorized_keys
    cd ..
    chmod a+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx .ssh
    cd .ssh
    chmod a+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx,u-x authorized_keys
    nano authorized_keys 
    add public key : ssh -rsa <key here> (all on one line)


- FTP

    transfer files to and from server
    need to download a ftp client : winscp, filezilla etc..
    can use it with password or public-pvt key pair
