- What are environment variables:

    Variables which are specific to en environment
    For example if you want to store a secret token that you do not want to share with other Users
    This way each user needs to set their own value for this env variable
    to print out env variables:
    env
    print out specific env varibles:
    printenv <var name>
    another way:
    echo $<var name>
    Craete env variables/change existing variable values:
    export <var name>=<value>
    this is only stored for current session

    for persistent variables (for current user):
    in the home dir - nano .bashrc
    anywhere in the file
    export <var name>="Values"
    exit out of the file
    source .bashrc

    create persistent global variables (for all users):
    cd /etc
    nano environment
    export <var name>="<value>"
    exit out of the file
    source environment

    Remove env variables from current session
    unset <var name>
