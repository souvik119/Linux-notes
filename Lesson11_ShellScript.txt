- Create a shell script file:

    vi test.sh


- Contents of shell script:

    At the top add a shebang
    #!/bin/bash - means use bash to run this script

    # - comment in a shell script

- Example scripts:

    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Hello World!"
    echo "Hi"

- Run script:

    ./test.sh
    - if permission denied check file permission
    chmod +x test.sh

- Function in shell script:

    print() {
        echo "Called function!"
    }

    #calling function
    print

    # using arguments in function
    print() {
        $1
        echo "Called function! $1"
    }

    print "souvik is great"

    - Variables in shell script:

        x=6
        souvik_ghosh=1

        echo $x

- Exit code:

    good practice to implement own exit code to signify if script execution was successful or not
    exit 0 - successful
    exit 1 - failure
    Exit will stop the script immediately

- If/ElIf/Else:

    control() {
        if [[ $1 = "Souvik" ]]; then
            echo "Souvik is great"
        elif [[ $2 = "Joe" ]]; then
            echo "Joe is great"
        else
            echo "Souvik is not great"
        fi
    }

    control "Souvik"
    control "Ghosh"

- User input:

    read -p "Name: " user_name
    echo $user_name
